# Basic-webscraping-of-data
**This project was created during my independent study class as a senior in high school. During my time here, I was focusing on learning rather than cleanliness of code. As of now (1/2/2020) I am making readability a priority!**

A basic webscraping of an Etsy page because I wanted to learn how automation worked. I also wanted to stop having to rely on third-party webscraping websites to scrape my own data.
